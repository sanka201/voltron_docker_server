The scripts directory is a central store for time saving interactions with
the shell and/or python scripts that automate as much as possible the 
administration of a volttron platform.

The admin directory is meant for one off scripts that will do a job and not 
generally are not meant to be called from other scripts.  For example the
volttron script is for launching volttron as a service using init.d or some
other mechanism.

The core directory is meant to have scripts that automate specific portions
of the technology stack in order to allow instances to configure themselves
effectively.

All other directories should be assumed to be customized for a specific need 
and should have a README associated with it in order to better document the 
purpose of the directory.

NOTE
All scripts should be run in an activated environment in order to use the 
command line interface for volttron.  In general scripts should be executed 
from the root volttron directory not from the scripts directory itself.
